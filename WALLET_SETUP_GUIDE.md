## Wallet Connection Issue

The "Connect Wallet" button might not work because you need a VeChain wallet installed. Here's how to fix it:

### Step 1: Install VeWorld Wallet

**For Desktop (Recommended):**
1. Go to [VeWorld.org](https://www.veworld.org/)
2. Download and install the VeWorld desktop app
3. Create or import a VeChain wallet
4. Make sure you're on the **TestNet** (this app uses TestNet)

**For Browser Extension:**
1. Install VeWorld browser extension from the official website
2. Set it up with a wallet
3. Switch to TestNet mode

### Step 2: Test Connection

1. Open the application at http://localhost:3000
2. Look for the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner
3. Click it and follow the prompts

### Step 3: Debugging

If the wallet still doesn't connect:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. Look for debug messages when you click "Connect Wallet"
3. Check these common issues:

   - **No wallet installed**: You'll see "VeWorld wallet not found"
   - **Wrong network**: Make sure you're on VeChain TestNet
   - **Browser compatibility**: Try Chrome or Firefox

## Application Features

Once the wallet is connected, you can:

1. **Business Registration** - Register entities with SHA-256 proof
2. **Proof Upload** - Upload files and record their hash on VeChain
3. **Verification** - Search and verify existing records
